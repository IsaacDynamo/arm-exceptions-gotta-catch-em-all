# ARM Exceptions: Gotta Catch 'Em All!
Self imposed challenge to cause and handle as many nested exceptions as possible on a Cortex-M4.

A stack-backtrace will be our Pok√©dex, as it will contain all catched exceptions.

## Progress
The following exceptions have been catched.
- [x] Reset
- [x] NMI
- [x] HardFault
- [x] MemManage
- [x] BusFault
- [x] UsageFault
- [x] SVCall
- [ ] DebugMonitor
- [x] PendSV
- [x] SysTick
